    <h1>A little information about me</h1>
    <p>I was born in capital city of Estonia named Tallinn. Here ive got my education and started to work in a construction. But at some point i've started to realize, that it is not what i want to do for my entire life. So i've quit that job and started to learn programming language such as Python, Java Script, Flask and etc.</p>
